# Algorithm Zone

## How we work?

1. Each week, a moderator will be chosen to:

- create two or three problems (can be taken from Leetcode, Timus, SPOJ or any competitive programing site).
- categorize problems by levels
- summarize output (solutions + code)
- choose the new moderator

2. The rest will have to:

- submit code and peer-review (create a PR to this repo under `algorithms/solutions/` folder)
- only submit solution after **3 days**, do not ask for solution before you show something to prove that you have done your homework
- Exception: You could choose one of the following ways to do instead of doing algorithm homework:
  * Blogging (not trivial stuff, another members will evalulate that your blog is worth a replacement or not)
  * OSS (OpenSource contribution)

3. For people who does not follow the rule, they will have to pay 200000 VND (or
   10 USD) to the admin (using [paypal](https://paypal.me/hieuk09)). The penalty is for people who:

- don't summit any solutions in one week **OR**
- don't join any discussion

## Chatroom
- algorithm-input: general discussion for every technical things (algorithm, OS, FP..)
- algorithm-output: discussion for homework only
