How we work?

- Per week, we'll have two or three problems, everybody need to submit and peer-review
- Only submit solution after **3 days**, do not ask for solution before you show something to prove that you have done your homework
- Problems will be categorized by levels
- If you're working on other problems, you're welcomed to bring it up to a discussion, interesting problems will be archived here
- Each person will post a problem per week
